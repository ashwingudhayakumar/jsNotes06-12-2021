const runner={
	first:'Eluid',
	last:'kipchoge',
	country:'kenya',
	title:'Elder of the order of the golden heart of kenya'
}

order doesn't matter

const {first,last,time}=runner;

first=eluid   last=kipchoge   time=undefined


only already present key can be used so that would be time is undefined

but we can change the key name

const{country:nation,title:honorific}=runner;

nation=kenya,honorofic=elder of the order of the golden heart of kenya



using rest



const {first,last,...other}=runner;

first='Eluid'  last='kipchoge'  other={country:'kenya',title:'Elder of the order of the golden heart of kenya'};
