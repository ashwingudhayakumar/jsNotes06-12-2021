const form=document.querySelector('form');

form.innerText or textContent means we wont get anything

but if we type like

form.innerHTML

'<input type='text' placeholder='Bear Name'>
<input type='password' placeholder='password'>
<input type='submit'>'

form.innerHTML gives string so you have to type html as string to manipulate


const h1=document.querySelector('h1');
h1.innerHTML;
>>"My WebPage"
h1.innerHTML+='is cool'
'My WebPage is cool'

h1.innerHTML+= '<b>come</b>'
'My WebPage is cool COME'

h1.innerText +='<b>come</b>'
'My WebPage is cool COME <b>come</b>'

this is the differ between innerHTML as well as innerText
